### About me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
I'm a Front-end Developer.
I participated in the development of several digital projects, including institutional websites and e-commerces, which impact thousands of users and consumers. Always focused on user experience and results conversion.

Currently I have been working to improve and learning about ReactJS, seeking knowledge and developing some projects.

I also work with PHP, MySQL, Wordpress, Woocommerce and others. 

I like writing clean code and applying best practices. ‚ú®
